      'The world of real estate is changing — buildings that do not plan for carbon neutrality today may become stranded assets tomorrow.',
      'Buildings are responsible for a significant portion of global CO₂ emissions and are therefore increasingly becoming the focus of climate legislation and investment decisions.',
      'We will help you set a clear and verifiable path to decarbonisation in line with EU Taxonomy, ESG requirements, SBTi and global best standards.',
      'We use CRREM tools, digital building twins, and the BREEAM In-Use and LEED O+M frameworks — from accurate data collection and model calibration to designing measures that reduce emissions and increase the value of your property.',
      'The result is not only a reduction in your carbon footprint, but also an increase in the market value and competitiveness of your building at a time when decarbonisation is no longer an option but an obligation.'

        Certification systems such as BREEAM In-Use and LEED O+M provide a proven framework for collecting operational data, assessing environmental performance and identifying areas for improvement.<br>
        Their implementation is often the first step towards decarbonisation, because:
        <ul>
              <li>They ensure systematic monitoring of energy, water and emissions consumption</li>
              <li>They create a clear structure for planning measures</li>
              <li>They provide internationally recognised verification of environmental performance, which strengthens credibility with investors and banks</li>

        The result is a comparison of projected CO₂ emissions with a Paris Agreement-compatible "carbon pathway", including the identification of stranded asset risks — buildings that could lose their market value without action.`

        We calibrate the model based on measured energy consumption and climate data, ensuring high accuracy of predictions and proposed measures.<br>
        The digital twin allows us to test decarbonisation strategies — from optimising operating parameters to proposing technical upgrades — without interfering with actual operations.`

        We ensure that data is presented in accordance with the requirements of investors, banks and regulatory authorities.<br>
        The result is transparent and verifiable documentation prepared for due diligence, certification processes and public ESG reports.`

        Our models can simulate the impact of individual measures on the long-term fulfilment of climate goals and the financial sustainability of a building.`
