          'BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) is an internationally recognised certification system for assessing sustainable buildings. It sets criteria for the environmental, social and economic sustainability of buildings and allows verification that a project is truly "green".'

      {
        title: 'How does the BREEAM certification process work?',
        content:
          'The BREEAM process begins with an analysis of achievable certification levels, cost calculations, goal setting, project registration, and the conducting of simulations, studies, and assessments, including assigning tasks to the project team and checking documentation. Subsequently, a pre-certificate application is submitted, communication with the authority takes place, and during construction, manuals are processed, compliance with requirements is monitored, and documentation, including translations, is collected. Finally, the final certificate is issued, with overall coordination by a consultant such as SALVIS.The advice is to start as soon as possible to minimize costs and maximize the level.'

        title: 'What is the difference between BREEAM and LEED?',
        content:
          'Both systems have their advantages, are mature, well-established and recognised. If the client has no preference and asks us to guide them, we steer them towards LEED in the case of office buildings that are not designed for a specific client. For residential and industrial buildings, as well as buildings that the investor is constructing for a known user, we tend to recommend BREEAM.

        title: 'How long does the certification process take?',

          'The length of the process depends on the stage at which certification begins. It is most effective to involve us in the early stages of the project. The entire process can take several months, from analysing options and developing strategies to the final audit and issuance of the certificate.'

        title: 'When is it appropriate to start certification?',

      },
      {
        title: 'How much does BREEAM certification cost?',
        content: `The cost of BREEAM certification depends on several factors, such as the level of certification, the time involved in the project, the experience of the consultant and team, and the availability of "no cost" points from the building's location. For the Excellent level or lower, they represent a 0-1% increase in total construction costs, while for Outstanding it can be 0-10%, with early involvement of an experienced consultant minimizing costs to 0-2%, but late involvement can increase them to 0-10% or lead to a lower level of certification. The total costs cannot be fully generalized, as they depend on the baseline standard of each building, and the more committed the team, the lower the expenses.`
