  <h1 class='fw-bold'>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    Our company (SALVIS, s.r.o.), acting as the controller of your personal data, approaches this
    activity professionally and in accordance with good morals, and only for a defined or specified
    purpose.
  </p>
  <p>
    When processing personal data, we fully comply with the requirements of Act No. 18/2018 Coll. on
    the protection of personal data and on amendments to certain acts (hereinafter referred to as
    the "PD Act") and Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the
    protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free
    movement of such data.
  </p>
  <p>
    We process personal data only in the manner and within the limits set out in this Act so as not
    to violate the fundamental rights and freedoms of the persons concerned, in particular their
    right to human dignity or other unjustified interference with their right to privacy.
  </p>

  <h3>Analytics</h3>

  <p>
    We use Plausible Analytics to understand how visitors use our site. Plausible is a
    privacy-first, cookieless analytics service that measures traffic trends without using cookies,
    local storage or persistent identifiers.
  </p>

  <h5>Purpose & legal basis</h5>
  <p>
    We process analytics data to monitor and improve our website (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR — legitimate
    interests). You can object to this processing at any time (Art. 21 GDPR) by contacting us using
    the details below. <a href='https://plausible.io/data-policy'
      >You can learn more about Plausible.io data policy here</a
    >
  </p>

  <h5>What Plausible collects (on our behalf)</h5>
  <p>
    Plausible records only a small set of non-identifying data: page URL (with most query parameters
    removed), HTTP referrer, browser and OS (derived from the User-Agent), device type, and
    approximate location (country/region/city) derived from the IP address. IP addresses and full
    User-Agents are not stored.
  </p>
  <h5>No cookies / no access to your device</h5>
  <p>
    Plausible does not set cookies and does not read or write any information to your device. To
    estimate unique visitors per day without tracking individuals, Plausible creates a daily,
    rotating hash from your IP address and User-Agent plus a per-day salt and the site’s domain. The
    raw IP address and User-Agent are never written to disk and the salt is deleted every 24 hours,
    so the hash cannot be linked across days.
  </p>

  <h5>Where processing happens & recipients</h5>
  <p>
    Our analytics data are processed in the European Union. Plausible Insights OÜ (Västriku tn 2,
    50403 Tartu, Estonia) operates the service. Visitor data are stored in Germany on servers run by
    Hetzner (EU-owned), and Plausible uses Bunny (EU-owned) as its CDN/DDoS provider. We have a Data
    Processing Agreement in place with Plausible.
  </p>

  <h5>Retention</h5>
  <p>
    We store only aggregated analytics (no raw IP addresses). Aggregates are retained [set your
    period here, e.g., 12 months] to analyze trends, after which we delete or further aggregate
    them. (Plausible deletes the daily salt every 24 hours, preventing linkage across days.)
  </p>

  <h5>Transfers outside the EEA</h5>
  <p>According to Plausible, analytics data do not leave the EU.</p>

  <h5>Your choices</h5>
  <p>
    If you prefer not to be counted in our analytics, you can use common privacy tools (e.g.,
    content blockers). You can also opt-out using the toggle button on <a href='/plausible-exclude/'
      >this page</a
