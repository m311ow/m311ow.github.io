**New Office Building near Tower 115 — Modern and Sustainable**

The new 14-storey office building rises on a site formerly occupied by a parking lot and low-quality technical structures, adjacent to **Tower 115** and in direct connection to the **Panorama City** residential complex. Its design includes a **four-floor parking podium with retail spaces**, completing the surrounding city block.

With **Eurovea Shopping Center** nearby, the area offers abundant amenities and services, while excellent public transport links and the **Danube Cycleway** ensure accessibility and support sustainable mobility. To further encourage alternative transport, the building provides **cyclist showers and storage facilities** on the ground floor.

The project was prepared from the early design stages for **LEED certification**. **SALVIS** supported the project with complete LEED certification services, expert studies, and simulations.

**Sustainability Highlights**

- High-level **air filtration** and design preventing pollutant spread
- Preference for **regional building materials** and those with recycled content
- **Water savings** through efficient sanitary fixtures

This project demonstrates how underutilized plots can be transformed into sustainable, high-quality office spaces that enhance the urban environment.
