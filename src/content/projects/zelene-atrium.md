### LEED Platinum Passive House — A Residential Benchmark for Europe

This project is a **pioneering residential development**, setting a new standard for sustainable architecture in Slovakia and Central Europe. It is **one of the very few residential buildings in Europe certified with both LEED Platinum and Passivhaus**, proving that green design can deliver comfort, efficiency, and affordability.

Architect **Ing. arch. Miroslav Marko, M.Arch.**, also the owner of the building, integrated sustainability into the very core of the design. From the start, he aimed for a building that would become a **model of responsible architecture**, demonstrating that sustainability does not come at a premium but as a natural part of smart design.

The project team included leading specialists:

- **Energy-concept, s.r.o.** — designer of the building envelope, blower-door testing, ensuring airtightness and energy performance below **15 kWh/m²/year**
- **ESM YZAMER** — automation, metering, and user-friendly monitoring to make the building resilient to rising energy costs
- **e-Dome, s.r.o.** — energy modeling, daylighting and VOC measurements, and LEED process consultancy
- **SALVIS** — complete LEED certification services, including technical studies and simulations

**Sustainability Highlights**

- Among the **few projects in Europe with both LEED Platinum and Passivhaus certifications**
- **First residential passive house in Slovakia**, energy use below **15 kWh/m²/year**
- **Brownfield redevelopment**, turning an abandoned site into a vibrant community
- Over **90 % of materials from the original building recycled** (~1 500 tons reused for backfilling and site preparation)
- **Zero-VOC policy** for healthy indoor air, especially important for families with children
- **Heat pump technology** and **mechanical ventilation with heat recovery**
- **Rainwater reuse** for irrigation, reducing potable water demand

This project shows how sustainability and innovation can go hand in hand. It is not only a green building, but also a visionary model for the future of residential architecture in Europe.
