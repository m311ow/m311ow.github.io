### Residential Project Trenčín — Green Living by the River

The project consists of two four-storey buildings (Houses B and C) and one five-storey building (House A). The ground floor combines retail, covered parking, and bicycle storage, while additional exterior parking is provided at the front. Six EV charging stations are installed, with more planned for the premium apartments in House A. Each building has its own bike storage room, supplemented by outdoor racks for retail visitors.

A significant portion of the site is dedicated to green areas with native and adaptive plants, while the northern section was left undisturbed during construction to support local biodiversity.

**Sustainability Highlights**

- One of only two LEED-certified residential projects in Slovakia
- EV charging stations and cyclist-friendly infrastructure
- Protection of indoor air quality during construction and use of ultra-low VOC materials
- Large landscaped areas enhancing ecological and recreational value

Salvis provided complete LEED certification services, including technical studies and environmental simulations.

This project demonstrates how sustainable residential design can successfully combine modern living, ecological responsibility, and community well-being in Trenčín.
