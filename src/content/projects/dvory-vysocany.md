### Dvory Vysočany — LEED Gold Office Development in Prague

Dvory Vysočany is a new **core & shell office building** in Prague designed to achieve **LEED Gold certification**. The project is part of a wider urban regeneration, surrounded by residential buildings and connected to a shared underground garage.

The site, formerly occupied by an industrial roastery and warehouses, will undergo complete demolition and environmental remediation. Contaminated soil will be safely removed and disposed of, while new green and public spaces will enhance the quality of the district.

The design team includes **Siebert, Talaš**, **Owa Architekti**, and **LAN 05 landscape architects**. The building's energy concept is based on **gas heat pumps complemented by peak heating and cooling sources**, ensuring both efficiency and resilience.

**Sustainability and Mobility**

- **Rainwater retention and green roofs** to reduce runoff and improve microclimate
- Parking exclusively in the garage, with every fifth space equipped for **electric vehicles**
- Close links to **public transport, cycling routes, and a nearby railway station**, with future railway connections planned
- **Exterior shading** integrated into the façade for energy efficiency and comfort

Dvory Vysočany will transform a brownfield site into a **modern and sustainable office destination**, contributing to the revitalization of the district while targeting **LEED Gold certification**.
