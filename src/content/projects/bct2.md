### Business Centrum Tesla 2 — Modern Green Offices in Košice

Business Centrum Tesla 2 is the second phase of the successful BCT office project, located on Moldavská Street in southern Košice. Thanks to its position on one of the city's main traffic routes, the building offers excellent accessibility by both car and public transport.

Developed by Penta Investments, a.s., the project reflects the company's focus on high-quality office, residential, and retail developments. Their commitment to premium construction and smart spatial planning is evident throughout the design.

From the very beginning, the project was prepared for LEED certification, with sustainability at its core. In cooperation with e-DOME and SALVIS, a green concept was created to ensure energy efficiency, healthy working environments, and future-ready mobility.

Built on the site of a former parking lot, the building has seven above-ground floors with open, flexible office spaces and generous green areas. On the ground floor, employees benefit from bicycle storage, changing rooms, and showers, supporting eco-friendly commuting. Dedicated charging stations for electric vehicles highlight the building's forward-looking approach to mobility.

Business Centrum Tesla 2 combines accessibility, sustainability, and modern design — setting a new benchmark for office spaces in Košice.
