### BASTION OFFICE CENTER — Modern Comfort in Historic Košice

BASTION OFFICE CENTER stands at the edge of Košice's historic core, designed in harmony with heritage regulations while offering state-of-the-art office spaces. The building provides excellent accessibility thanks to nearby public transport, bike paths, and a full range of services.

Workspaces are equipped with efficient floor heating and cooling systems powered by underground water wells with heat pumps and free cooling. Modern ventilation ensures fresh air throughout offices, retail areas, and common spaces.

Energy-efficient LED lighting with daylight and motion controls, advanced metering, and smart socket distribution reduce energy use while maintaining comfort. Emergency lighting and safety systems meet strict EU standards.
