### Major Reconstruction — First LEED v4 Certified Building in Slovakia

Originally built between 1974–1978 as the telecommunications headquarters of the Žilina region, the former post office building no longer met modern requirements. Instead of demolition, the decision was made to preserve the steel structure and part of the basement, while all other elements were carefully dismantled and 95.7 % of construction waste recycled. The result is a major reconstruction that transformed the site into a pioneering green building.

**This project became the first in Slovakia to achieve LEED v4 certification. It has been widely recognized with awards including:**

- VISIO 2020 for sustainable achievement
- Building of the Year in the categories _Exceptional Construction Quality_ and _Application of Science and Research_

**Sustainability Highlights**

- **Heat Island Reduction** — Reflective white roof and parking surfaces reduce overheating, lower cooling demand, and protect rooftop technology. Additional trees were preserved and planted to provide natural shading and comfort.
- **Tree Protection** — Even trees in immediate proximity to the building were preserved. Heavy machinery was restricted near root zones to prevent damage.
- **Water Savings** — Low-flow fixtures and efficient toilets save over 2 million liters of potable water annually. Rainwater is collected in tanks and reused for irrigation.
- **Alternative Mobility** — Cyclists benefit from ground-floor storage, showers, and changing rooms. EV charging stations are integrated into the parking facilities.
- **Healthy Indoor Environment** — HVAC ducts were protected during construction, and high-performance filters maintain clean indoor air in operation. Only ultra-low VOC materials were used.
- **Energy Efficiency** — Advanced simulations of building behavior and annual energy demand helped optimize systems for long-term performance.

**Building Features**

- Atrium design serving as an entrance buffer, meeting, and relaxation zone
- Ground floor with canteen, retail, and cyclist infrastructure
- 4 upper office floors, 1 underground level for storage and technical spaces
- Dedicated recycling storage facility within 30 m of the building
- District heating as heat source; efficient chillers and dry cooler for free cooling; DX cooling for server rooms
- Energy-efficient LED lighting with daylight and occupancy control, emergency lighting with 60-minute backup
- Smart electrical distribution with 50 % of outlets controlled by occupancy sensors or schedules
