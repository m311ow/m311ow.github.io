### Euroterrace — Modern Sustainable Living in Žilina

**Euroterrace** is a newly envisioned, multifunctional residential complex in Žilina, pre-certified as **LEED Gold** — a testament to its commitment to sustainability, quality, and environmental responsibility.

Designed to rejuvenate an underutilized zone, the project introduces 80 contemporary units featuring **BKT ceiling heating and cooling**, integrated heat recovery, and spacious layouts with generous **wood-aluminium windows** that flood interiors with daylight. Each residence comes with its own **balcony, terrace, or front garden**, creating private spaces for outdoor living, while a **playground** invites families to enjoy a safe, communal environment.

Sustainability extends beyond the living spaces. **Electric vehicle charging stations** accompany ample parking, encouraging green mobility. The LEED Gold pre-certification underscores the use of **high-quality materials and cutting-edge technologies**, positioning Euroterrace as a future-proof and desirable address in Žilina.
