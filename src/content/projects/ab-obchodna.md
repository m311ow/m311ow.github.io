### Modern Office Building in the Heart of Žilina

This modern office building brings together top accessibility, smart design, and sustainable solutions. Located just steps from public transport and cycling routes, it encourages green commuting — supported by a spacious bike hub on the ground floor.

The building offers bright, flexible office spaces across 9 floors, underground parking, and a welcoming lobby with biophilic design. Employees can also enjoy landscaped surroundings and a rooftop terrace with panoramic views.

Efficient systems ensure comfort and sustainability: district heating, energy-saving cooling, fresh air supply via modern ventilation units, LED lighting with smart controls, and advanced energy metering. Safety is secured through high fire-safety standards, emergency lighting, and robust electrical design.

This project transforms a neglected site into a future-ready workplace — setting a new benchmark for offices in Žilina.
