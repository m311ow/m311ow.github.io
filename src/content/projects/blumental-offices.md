### Blumental Office — Sustainable Landmark in Bratislava

**Budova získala ocenenie CIJ Leading Green Building Development & Developer.**

Blumental Office is part of a modern business complex in Bratislava's Old Town, located between Mýtna and Radlinského Streets. The project revitalizes the site of the former tobacco plant and blends seamlessly into its historic surroundings, while offering excellent accessibility by car and public transport.

Developed by Blumental Office I, s.r.o., the building was designed with sustainability in mind from the very beginning. In cooperation with e-Dome and SALVIS, a LEED-certified green concept was created, focusing on energy efficiency, comfort, and sustainable mobility.

The office building rises six floors on the north side and twelve on the south, with two underground levels dedicated to parking and technical infrastructure. The ground floor features a welcoming lobby and retail spaces, while generous green and recreational areas enhance the urban environment.

To support sustainable commuting, the building provides bicycle racks, changing rooms, and showers. Key environmental measures include the use of heat pump technology, above-standard energy efficiency, and specialized studies such as thermodynamic simulation, thermal comfort analysis, and daylight optimization.

Blumental Office sets a new benchmark for sustainable office development in Bratislava — where modern design, urban revitalization, and green innovation meet.
