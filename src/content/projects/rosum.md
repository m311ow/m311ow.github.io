### AB Ružinov ROSUM — Green Landmark in Bratislava

AB Ružinov ROSUM is a mixed-use building with a strong focus on office spaces, located at the busy intersection of Bajkalská and Ružinovská Streets in Bratislava. The project was designed with sustainability in mind from the very beginning. e-Dome actively contributed to the green concept for LEED certification.

The building features a shared base with two towers – North and South, rising above two underground and eleven above-ground floors. By placing parking underground, the project maximizes open space and greenery within the site boundary.

To support sustainable commuting, extensive bicycle infrastructure was implemented in the underground floors of both towers – including racks, storage rooms, showers, and changing facilities. Electric vehicle charging stations further encourage low-carbon mobility.

The project was also nominated for the VISIO 2020 award for outstanding contributions to sustainable construction.

**Sustainability Highlights**

- EV charging stations integrated into underground parking
- Full bicycle facilities — storage, showers, and lockers for cyclists
- Rich landscaping with local plant species
- First building in Bratislava to implement innovative water-saving sanitary fixtures
- Use of low-GWP refrigerants with zero ozone depletion potential
- Over 75 % of construction waste recycled or reused
- Preference for local suppliers of building materials

AB Ružinov ROSUM sets a benchmark for modern sustainable offices in Bratislava, combining innovative design, high-quality green infrastructure, and a commitment to environmental responsibility.
