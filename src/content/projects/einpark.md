### Einpark Offices — Sustainable Gateway to Bratislava

Einpark Offices was developed on the site of a former industrial area, transforming it into a modern, sustainable workplace in one of Bratislava's most attractive locations. Just a short walk from the city center, Janko Kráľ Park, the Danube River, and Aupark shopping center, the site offers excellent connectivity by public transport and easy access to all parts of the city.

The biggest challenge of the location is its proximity to Einsteinova Street and the D1 highway, which bring noise and dust from the north. At the same time, this orientation offers spectacular views of Bratislava Castle. These contrasting conditions shaped the architectural concept: the building's L-shaped design creates a sound barrier shielding the inner courtyard, while the north façade opens towards the city with plenty of daylight.

The office building has seven floors, topped with an accessible green roof for relaxation. It shares underground levels with a neighboring residential building, although only the office portion is included in the LEED certification.

**Sustainability Highlights**

- Green roofs to reduce the urban heat island effect
- Underground parking to free surface space for greenery
- Rainwater collection in retention tanks, reused for irrigation or infiltration
- Double-skin façade minimizing noise pollution and improving energy efficiency
- Water-source heat pumps for low-carbon heating and cooling
- Infrastructure for cyclists and electric vehicles

Einpark Offices demonstrates how thoughtful design can turn a challenging site into a high-quality, sustainable workplace with a strong architectural identity and a commitment to the environment.
