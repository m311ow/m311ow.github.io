### Vilharia — The Greenest Office Building in Slovenia

Vilharia aspires to be a landmark in the heart of Ljubljana, where modern innovation meets timeless natural principles. The project transforms an underused concrete-covered site into a sustainable, people-focused business hub. Inspired by Nordic architectural traditions, Vilharia combines warmth, elegance, and environmental responsibility. With its **LEED Platinum precertification**, it is set to become the **greenest office building in Slovenia**.

A defining feature of the project is its active green roofs, which reduce the urban heat island effect, improve air quality, and create accessible outdoor spaces for tenants. Together with advanced technologies and an ideal central location, Vilharia will set a new benchmark for green offices in Slovenia.

**Premises**

- Typical floorplate of over 5 500 m²
- Flexible design suitable for large single tenants or multiple smaller units
- Five elevator cores providing high accessibility and efficiency
- Vibrant ground floor dedicated to tenant and visitor amenities, open to the street and fostering community interaction

**Location**

Vilharia is strategically located next to Ljubljana's central station and the future Transport Hub — the country's largest transport node and commercial center. With excellent access to public transport, parking, services, and connections across Slovenia, the project is destined to become the core of a flourishing business district.

Vilharia is not just an office building — with its **LEED Platinum precertification**, it is designed to become a living, sustainable community, offering modern workplaces in harmony with nature.
