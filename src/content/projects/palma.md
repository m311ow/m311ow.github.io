### PALMA — From Industrial Brownfield to Bratislava's Greenest District

PALMA is a large-scale transformation of a former industrial site in the northeast of Bratislava, with a **LEED Platinum precertification**. The area was once home to the **Palma factory**, a significant part of Slovakia's food industry focused on the production of vegetable oils and fats. Over time, production ceased, the site was abandoned, and the grounds fell into decay. Today, the vision is to turn this neglected brownfield into the **first local center of Bratislava and the city's greenest district**.

In collaboration with **Gehl Architects**, the concept of Palma puts people and quality of life at the heart of the design. The new neighborhood will blend **modern, sustainable technologies** with the site's **industrial heritage**, breathing new life into preserved original buildings while introducing timeless architecture and generous green spaces.

**Key Features**

- **Mixed-use district** offering both homes and workplaces for hundreds of people
- **Brownfield regeneration**, preserving the industrial _genius loci_ while revitalizing the community
- **Excellent transport connectivity** — tram access, two nearby railway stations, and the future TIOP Mladá Garda stop
- **Active mobility first** — a neighborhood designed for walking and cycling everywhere
- **Sustainable vision** — combining renewable technologies, green roofs, water management, and human-centered design

Palma has the ambition to become **the most sustainable and community-friendly urban district ever built in Bratislava** — a green, vibrant, and inclusive neighborhood for the future.
